Simple file to mock all Google Maps API.
I'll add classes and methods evrey time I need it. But feel free to fork and pull requests!

I use it to write Jasmine tests for new maptimize JS API (http://v2.maptimize.com) and navia JS API (http://navia.com)

It's written in CoffeeScript because I really like CoffeeScript, As Sam Stephenson, I wish to never write Javascript again :)

I don't plan to write tests for that for now, I'm not a masochist to write test for mock objects used to write test. But who knows, may I'll do it
